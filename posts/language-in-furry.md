title: Language In Furry

This article takes a look at a few of the linguistic traits common within the furry fandom.  As a source, there are several megabytes of anonymized logs that I will use to explore some of the things that stand out as important in the ways in which furries communicate with each other.

Meow Meow Meow! A Survey of Phatic Expressions in the Furry fandom

Body-Language in Words in Casual Furry Role Play
------------------------------------------------

One of the side effects of having a relatively unique mode of communication in the form of casual role play is that we see a lot of different communication styles made explicit in the words we use to convey actions.  This means that we have a written record of haptic - that is interaction that occurs through touch - and visual communication.

Haptic communication, especially, plays a very important role in social species of all kinds.  Humans, as those who drive our furry avatars, are certainly no exception.

(also haptic communication through affection, visual communication through wagging)
