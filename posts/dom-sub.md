title: Domination and Submission in the Furry Subculture
---

When I first started getting into furry, it was towards the tail end of puberty. I'd have to say that my experience with puberty was fairly standard, other than that.  Burgeoning fantasies, swelling desires, and other enticing metaphors; I'll spare you the details.  Naturally, for a kid exploring sexuality early in life, there were few better places than the internet, and one could certainly have done worse than furry for as a source of sexualized art, stories, and scenarios, if one was willing to dig.

The irony of going through a chemically induced second puberty and having it instead be decidedly asexual is not lost on me, but I digress.<!--more-->

One of the things that caught my eye almost immediately was the prevalence of domination and submission within the culture of furry, particularly enshrined within sexual acts as portrayed through writing, art, and role-play.  Everywhere I looked, there were images of furries in collars attached by leases, discussion of masters and pets, and power differentials of every kind intertwined through the relationships that made up the furry fandom, or at least it's more sexual side.

D/s relationships were far more common, and far more visible within furry than I had expected.  I had been reading voraciously about sex and sexuality from early on in puberty, at least as far as I was allowed to, and I had been under the impression that BDSM played a relatively small part of sex for the great majority of people, and so it came as a surprise to me how widely it was tolerated and embraced within our subculture.

Within furry, power differentials manifest in many, many ways.  As I mentioned before, collars are nearly ubiquitous within furry.  I've owned several, myself, over the years, even, though I have a hard time wearing anything that constrictive on a regular basis.  Beyond collars, one is now starting to see more and more elaborate gear get-ups out there in furry, from harnesses which fit over the chest and shoulders, to hoods and mitts which limit mobility and visibility.

These tangible signs of dominance and submission, often tied with bondage as well, are merely the signifiers of a more abstract power dynamic at play.  Notable within furry is the dynamic of master and pet, which....

This power differential extends beyond furry's simple adoption of pet-play from the larger BDSM community, and finds its way into several other interests, both sexual and non-sexual.  It can affect the way one dresses or presents oneself, the reliance on others, and the ways in which friendships and sexual relationships wind up structured.

Furry lends to this a flair all of its own, in several ways.  For instance, there is automatically a difference in power between predator and prey species that the participants can take advantage of, even though
(also through species and size difference, giving a furry-specific flair)

(furry as a vehicle for differentials, which are experienced outside of the fandom)

(More submissive than dominant, why is that?  Is it furry?  Some ideas)

(Furry is a place of comfort, being dominated is also a form of comfort, they go together)

(submission is also transgressive in western society, especially for men)
("A 1995 study indicates that 89% of heterosexual females who are active in BDSM expressed a preference for the submissive-recipient role in sexual bondage, expressing also a preference for a dominant male, and that 71% of heterosexual males preferred a dominant-initiator role.[3]" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_and_submission)

(How does this fit in with the transgressive nature of furry?)

(find some damn way to conclude without sounding like a trite shithead)
