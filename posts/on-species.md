Puberty was an interesting time for me.

How's that for a hook?

Puberty was an interesting time for me.  I feel like there's a lot of different stages of life that get boiled down to standard narratives.  For folk generally assumed to be boys, this takes place as a burgeoning sexuality.  This sexuality is comprised of unbridled urges, unquenchable lust, and, most importantly, inopportune erections.  You are assumed to be a confused hornball who knows nothing about what is happening.

The reality was much more plain.  I spent a lot of time furtively exploring the concept of masturbation in my bedroom's closet, coming up with vast fantasies.  Or riding as a passenger in the car coming up with vast fantasies.  Or racing through my classes, coming up with vast fantasies.

I constructed huge worlds in my head where, at first, my pretty girlfriend and I would roll around during a picnic.  Later, it would become my handsome boyfriend and I.  Eventually, I would lose track and include them both some massive, megalomaniacal fantasy where everything would work perfectly.

The thing that caught my attention, after my fair share of middle school sleepovers, was that there was nothing that I was experiencing that was out of the norm for boys growing up in America during the 90s.  I suspect that the same reaches across both time and space, though at the time, I was blessed with nothing but a libido, no foresight nor interest into what came before, nor any experience with the world beyond my central-Colorado upbringing.

There was nothing new about this massive constructing of sexual and sensual worlds from a masculine standpoint.  I would never be the first boy to spend way too much time on road trips imagining picnic sex, and I'm sure that I'll not be the last.  Given then I am, as of writing, twenty-nine years old, the chance for future generations to fantasize about red-and-white checkered blankets grows higher by the day.

Of course, from the inside, it was all unique.  I was the one taking part, and that made it something that was special to me.  I was the one fantasizing, the fantasy worlds were about me, and they were imagined solely for me.

If there was any aspect of coming of age as a sexual person among my cohort that was unique, it was that I was coming of age as a furry.

That's not to say that furries were unique, nor even that they were unique among my cohort, the late-puberty, middle school graduating class of 2000.  Hell, by then, I was pretty sure that I wasn't the only gay kid.  However, as I transitioned from middle school into high school, I was the only one that I knew of.

I was the only Ranna.

By the time I had made my way through middle school and started into high school, I was dating a wonderful boy by the name of Danny\*.  It was a long-distance relationship, with me in Colorado and him in New York

\* In the process of writing this article, I found a year and a half old obituary for Danny.  I won't go into too much depth - there has been a lot of death here on \[a\]\[s\] of late - but know that he burned bright and lived an amazing life.
