title: On Creativity
---

When I was going to school for composition, just about every class that touched on music history, and there were quite a few, touched on the idea of innate talent, and almost always using Mozart as an example.  However, the classes weren't necessarily expounding on how great it is to be innately talented, some sort of musical genius.  After all, when talking to a bunch of kids at a state school studying to become musicians, one wouldn't really want to argue that greatness must be inherited.  And indeed, there's little argument to be made for innate talent as the sole determinant for greatness, or even something worth taking into account.  "There is probably no clearer waste of psychic energy than worrying about how much talent you have," write the authors of Art and Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking.  "Talent, if anything, is a gift, and nothing of the artist's own making. [...] Even at best, talent remains a constant, and those who rely upon that gift alone, without developing further, peak quickly and soon fade to obscurity."

This also applies, I've found, to creativity.  Creativity, while not afflicted quite as strongly as talent, is still seen by many as some sort of inborn characteristic that must be cherished or nurtured within the few it's graced with its presence.  Rather, creativity has more to do with drive than it does inherited characteristics.  Creativity is a tool that we all possess, and without the drive to move forward, solve problems, or whatever is necessary at the moment, it can go relatively unused.  This was the majority of my experience in school.  The assignments, the rote knowledge, the history and the techniques classes were all there to teach the student to quit worrying about talent and creativity and start worrying about how best to utilize the tools that just about everyone has at their disposal.  While this may seem like some sort of "ode to hard work", it does well to express the fact that we all have at our disposal the ability to create, not just to consume.  And here is a place where I feel that the furry subculture really shines.

If talent and creativity are more about drive than innateness, then what drive does the furry world provide that has creativity playing such a big aspect of our lives?  That is, what about creating within the fandom fulfills that drive or desire?  (drive; what desires creating within the fandom fulfills - characters, affirmation, world-building (fandom aspect))

(the process of creation)
