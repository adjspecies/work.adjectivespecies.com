I don’t think that’s true, but I want to discuss and refine.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:20 PM]:
Oh, yeah, I saw that go by.

Lemme finish cooking first

ICE (3) Russel Reed, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:22 PM]:
Okay!

Madison Scott-Clary, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:26 PM]:
Hokay, SO

I don't think furry is sex-positive, or, at least, as sex-positive as we like to think we are.

I think we're hypocritical and get really defensive when called out on that.

The term gets overused, but the amount of kinkshaming that goes on in furry is ridiculous, and we have a pathological need to cover up our sexuality in a lot of cases.

If sex-positivity were a tenet of furry, we'd be able to have all-ages safer sex panels, and frank discussions of kink without it attracting ire.

ICE (3) Russel Reed, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:32 PM]:
Yep, I think you basically got it.

But!

I don’t necessarily buy “sex-positive” == “all about sex"

Like, I tap out even earlier than you. :P

Before you even enter furry.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:32 PM]:
That's only part of it, though of course. Perhaps there is something to the conjecture that our actions are read in the context of a set of assumptions, but even then, mainstream culture ISN'T as sex-negative as often assumed

ICE (3) Russel Reed, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:33 PM]:
I mean, I think the US is pretty sex-negative. But that’s also a Big Hard Question®.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:33 PM]:
Oh, no, I get that, I don't mean to imply that sex-positivity is just all about sex. It's about Shame in the context of sex.

ICE (3) Russel Reed, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:34 PM]:
Yeah, okay!

Though I mean

The original tweet explicitly links the two.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:34 PM]:
Oh, yeah

ICE (3) Russel Reed, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:34 PM]:
And that’s what I was objecting to I guess.

I don’t even think that’s true on its face, much less in furry.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:34 PM]:
Oh yeah, for sure

Hmm

Getting the writing itch again.

Maybe a roundtable or something on this for LSF or [a][s]

ICE (3) Russel Reed, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:36 PM]:
Haha, oh yeah?

Madison Scott-Clary, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:37 PM]:
Just a thought

Anyway

ICE (3) Russel Reed, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:37 PM]:
Yeah! I’d be down.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:39 PM]:
Lemme think about it. Maybe I can set a thing up through twitter and email

I think that's how the other roundtables were done

ICE (3) Russel Reed, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:48 PM]:
Sure. :2

Sideways cat face.

I’m just thinking more, hm!

Like, the implication of “community is okay with X, therefore community must be entirely about X” is sorta weird.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:50 PM]:
Yeah, exactly. It's a really big assumption to make.

ICE (3) Russel Reed, [Aug 8, 2016, 5:55 PM]:
Yeah, hrm.

I guess it’s made particularly in the context of mainstream culture.

Lemme see if I can walk something through.

Mainstream culture is also anti-queer. But I don’t still don’t think queer media is necessarily all about queerness.

But maybe I’m wrong about that!

Madison Scott-Clary, [Aug 8, 2016, 6:02 PM]:
No, that's fair.  I'm… a little wary of the generalization involved in that, but I'm trying to come up with words around it.  The comparison is apt, though: some may consider SU to be queer media, but it's still enjoyed by kids vs. some may consider Robin Hood to be furry media but it's still enjoyed by kids
