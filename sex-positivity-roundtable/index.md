title: Roundtable on Sex-Positivity in Furry
---

After Grey's [fursuit comic on Oh Joy Sex Toy](http://www.ohjoysextoy.com/fursuits-grey-white/) went live, there was quite a bit of internet backlash on the subject of sexuality and fursuits.  While there is likely an article to be written on the subject of sexy, sexy fursuits, one thing that fell out of the conversation was a discussion around sex positivity or negativity within furry, in the world at large, and how the two interact.  Which brings us to this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">re &quot;furry is about sex&quot;:<br><br>mainstream culture is sex-negative. so the idea of &quot;sex-positive culture that isn&#39;t all about sex&quot; is unthinkable</p>&mdash; perennial sighworks (@4rafn) <a href="https://twitter.com/4rafn/status/762389487112581120">August 7, 2016</a></blockquote>

## Purpose

Lets sit down and talk about sex-positivity (and negativity!) within furry.  We have a complex relationship with sex, and it shows in the ways in which we speak and act.  Are we really as sex-positive as we like to say we are?  Are non-furries relaly so sex-negative?  What even is sex-positivity, and how does that play into a fandom that many see as a safe place to explore sexually?

## Questions going into the roundtable

* What is sex-positivity/negativity to you?
* Is furry a sex-positive space?  How?  More so than western culture at large?
* Can you think of counter-examples to the previous answer?  A particularly sex-positive/negative space that gives lie to your previous answer when taken as a generalization?
* If you could change one thing about furry in terms of sex-positivity, what would you change?
